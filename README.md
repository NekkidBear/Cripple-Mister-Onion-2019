# Cripple-Mister-Onion-2019 (abandoned)
Python 3 version of the Cripple Mr Onion

Currently it's a text based/cli type interface, but once the logic is working correctly, I'll implement a gui.

I originally started this as a hobby project in 2019, but since I was doing it during lulls at work, I never completed this version.
